# pythonPi
Pi calculator

This uses a previous pi demo calculator, which has been modified by me and Elliott

Current functionality:  Input the number of iterations through Chudnovsky's algorithm, timing the iterations and total run time.

Future functionality:  
* Take input from command line
* Either multi-thread or dask multiprocessing to speed up
